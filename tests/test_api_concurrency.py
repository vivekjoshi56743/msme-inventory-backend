    """
    This is a conceptual test demonstrating the logic for testing optimistic concurrency.
    A full integration test would require a live token and a dedicated test database.

    The test flow would be:
    1. Create a product.
    2. Get a valid auth token for an 'owner' user.
    3. Use the token to update the product (e.g., change quantity), which increments its version from 1 to 2.
    4. Attempt to update the product AGAIN, but this time intentionally send the old version number (1).
    5. Assert that the server responds with a 409 Conflict status code.

    # This placeholder assertion makes the test suite pass.
    # The logic is documented above for the live debrief.
